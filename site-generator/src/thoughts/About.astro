  <p>
    My name is Jordan Floyd and this is my personal website. 
    I am a Senior Software Engineer, currently working at <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>.
    This site contains my thoughts on various software engineering topics.

    My development experience primarily centers around using JavaScript / TypeScript with React for the frontend, JVM languages like Java, Scala, and Kotlin for the backend, and relational databases for storage.
